# Assignment 3 â€” Minimum Spanning Tree Optimization

## Overview
This project implements **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithms to optimize a city transportation network, minimizing total road construction cost.

Both algorithms are tested and compared for:
- Total MST cost
- Execution time (ms)
- Operation count (comparisons, unions, etc.)
- Scalability on graphs of different sizes and densities
